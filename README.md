Hi students from Lab 4 and Lab 5 in this year's Advanced Raster GIS course 
(ENVSOCTY-3GI3) taught by Patrick DeLuca from McMaster University. 
This is Haoran here, and I am using this Github repository page to post any 
slides I created and used for lab sessions. 
I hope during this winter these supplementary materials I made would help you 
somehow in getting comfort and achieving success when learning raster GIS.

Please do not distribute these slides without my permission. 
You are very welcomed to report any mistakes or bugs to me in 
[email](mailto:xu976@mcmaster.ca) or click the "Issues"
above to create a issue statement. 

Feel free to reach out!
