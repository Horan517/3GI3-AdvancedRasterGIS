Hi students from Lab 4 and Lab 5 in 2025 Winter ENVSOCTY-3GI3 course! This is Haoran here, 
and I am using this Github repository page to post any slides I created and used for lab 
sessions. I hope during this winter these supplymentary materials I made would help you somehow 
in getting comfort and achieving success in learning raster GIS.

Please do not distribute these slides without my permission, and also you are very welcomed to
report any mistakes or bugs to me in email. Feel free to reach out to my [email address](xu976@mcmaster.ca).
